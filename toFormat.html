result += `<h3>General Considerations (Both Singleplayer & Multiplayer)</h3>`
result += `<p>In vanilla Minecraft, you need a mechanism to activate the cannon while ensuring that the red (lazy) chunks remain unloaded.</p>`
result += `<h4>Viable "Remote" Activation Methods (to trigger the machine after leaving the area via a chunk loader):</h4>`
result += `<ul>`
result += `    <li>Item Despawn Timer</li>`
result += `    <li>Entity Detector (e.g., a minecart pressing against a pressure plate)</li>`
result += `    <li>Hopper Timer</li>`

result += `<h4>Alternative for Singleplayer (AFK in Chunk Loader Chunk)</h4>`
result += `<p>If you prefer to AFK in the chunk loader chunk, the simplest method is to build a redstone line extending to your chunk, allowing you to activate the cannon remotely.</p>`
